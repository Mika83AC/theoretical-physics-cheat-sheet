### Objects

#### Stars
Stars are the source of all atoms beside Hydrogen and Helium. Out of those two, all other atoms are "crafted" inside the stars by nuclear fusion and released upon their dead in hugh explosions called supernovae.

##### Neutron stars
The second most dense known objects in the entire universe, right after [black holes](#black-holes).

#### Black holes
The most dense objects in the entire universe. 
Even light can't escape them.
Space times breaks down because of their density, and so space and time doesn't make any more sense behind their event horizon.
